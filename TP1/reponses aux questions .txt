Description of the function plot_correlation_map(df)  : 


The function plot_correlation_map(df) creates a visual representation of how different numbers in a table are related to each other.
This function generates a colored map, where each number is like a data on the map , 
The color of each data point indicates whether it shares a positive correlation or a negative correlation with nearby data points.
In a correlation heatmap, each variable is represented by a row and a column, and the cells show the correlation between them. 
The color of each cell represents the strength and direction of the correlation, with darker colors indicating stronger correlations.
